In this project we shall analyze data from the IMDB movies database, to identify key characteristics that can inform best-selling movie genres, producers, and categories. This analysis will enable upcoming movie directors and movie companies to decide on the most profitable and populous types of movies and which other factors viewers appreciate when reviewing movies and rating them.
